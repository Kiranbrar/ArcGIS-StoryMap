# ArcGIS-StoryMap
Class project completed Information Visualization class at San Jose State University.

Worked collectively in a team of 3 to create dashboards in Tableau to illustrate Marco Polo's travels along the Silk Road.

Our team chose to implement the story using ArcGIS StoryMap for its clean, simple and beautiful design. More specifically, our team  used the GuidedTour Beta layout because we wanted to present a linear narrative and embedded multimedia, where each story point had a geolocation. 

Check out the attached report to see  how our team implemented the visualization.
